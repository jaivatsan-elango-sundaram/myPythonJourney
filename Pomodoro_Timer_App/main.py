    #we have this while looop so we dont end up having negative values

    #the arguments are the time in milliseconds, the commands that should be called, and then you have *args, so u have unlimited arguments that go inside the function being called

#we are making the width 200 and the height 224 because that is roughly the size of the underlying image 
#adding imag eusing the create_image method 
#to actually create the image we also need something called a PhotoImage
#a PhotoImage is a Tkinter class, which is a way to read through a file and get hold of a particular at a particular file location
tomato_image=PhotoImage(file = "tomato.png")
#arguments are a xposition, y position, and the the PhotoImage for that picture

#arguments will be x position, y position, and the text

#we are getting the color from a website called colorhunt.co, which contains a lot of sample color pallettes professionals use 
#we will be changing both the background and palette color 
canvas.config(bg = YELLOW)
window.config(bg = YELLOW)
#also changing highlight thickness because without it it looks weird, u can comment the line to see what happens
