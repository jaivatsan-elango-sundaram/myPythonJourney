#to have quotes in a string, use single quotes to surround the statement itself and use double quotes for the overall statement
#example:
print('Jeff said "hello"')
#to do print multiple lines using one print statement, use \n
#example:
print("Hello World\nHello World\nHello World")

#To get input from the user, use the input() function
#example:
input("Example prompt for the user")


#the line is replaced by what ever value was inputted, so you could even do this:
#input() will first get user input in the console
#Then. print() will print the word hello and the user input 
print("Hello" + input("what is your name?"))

#to find the number of characters in a string, use the len() function 
#example: 
exampleName = "bob"
print(len(exampleName))

#when you are creating a variable type in python, you do not have to mention the variable type
#for example:
phone = 123
name = "tom"

#variable naming tip: cannot start a variable name with a number (but you could write out the numbers name)
