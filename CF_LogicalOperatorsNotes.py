#greater than or equal to is >=
#less than or equal to is <=

#When you have one equal sign, you are assigning a value to something
#for example:
x = 12
#if you have two equal signs, you are checking if it meets a certain condition
#for example:
if x ==12:
    print("yes")
#nested if else statement. basically an if statement inside an if statement
#example:
'''
if condition:
    if another condition:
        do this
    else:
        do this
else:
    do this
'''

#use elif statement is you basically want to do else if 

#if you want to check if you want to check if multiple different conditions are true, instead of it just checking and stopping if the first one is true and stoppng if it is
#example:
'''
if condition 1 is true:
    do A
if condition 2 is true:
    do B
if condition 3 is true:
    do C 
'''
#an if, elif, and else for one stateement are kind of 'bunched together. an if statement after the else is indpendent from them

#use the phrase 'and' for doing and, do NOT use &

#use the phrase 'or' for doing or, do NOT use ||

#the phrase 'not', reverses the condition
#for example:
print(not 12>15)
